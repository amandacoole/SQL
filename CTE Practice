#I created my first CTE

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;


#Created another CTE for a different dataset:

WITH safety_average_cte AS (
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) as 'rating'
FROM citybikelanes
GROUP BY street)

SELECT 
street,
rating,
'safe lane' as 'label'
FROM safety_average_cte
WHERE rating >=4;
